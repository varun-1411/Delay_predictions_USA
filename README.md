# Predictive Analytics for Flight Delay Reduction in US Airports ✈️📉

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to predict and reduce flight delays in US airports. The dataset includes information from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and NOAA weather data.

## Key Features

- 🧹 Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing of BTS and NOAA datasets.
- 🤖 Applied advanced machine learning techniques, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR).
- ⏱ Achieved impressive results with a precise 7-minutes Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in predicting flight delays.
- 📊 Dealt with an imbalanced dataset of delayed and on-time flights through thorough data cleaning and feature extraction.
